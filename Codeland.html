        <h1>Nick in Codeland</h1>
        <p>This website is a map, a guide to all the places in Codeland.
            Join me on my quest as we discover this wonderous and mysterious land of code. 
            You can go North to Database Mountains where Kingdom Query mines and the language SQL reigns supreme.
            If beaches are your thing than travel south to the Beaches of Simplicity where Python reigns.
            If you don't know where to start than start here, in the Country of Websites, where the kings of HTML are married to the queens of CSS and they trade with everyone.
            There are still many places that I have yet to explore but as I explore them, I will document them here to help you on your journey.
            Good luck, safe travels, and may you not stop until you find your treasure.
